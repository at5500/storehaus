### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Simplified `create` method API - removed unnecessary `CreateResult` type
  - **Before**: `create()` returned `Result<(Model, CreateResult), Error>`
  - **After**: `create()` returns `Result<Model, Error>`
- **BREAKING**: SignalManager architecture refactored for better flexibility
  - SignalManager now created externally like CacheManager
  - Removed enable/disable methods - SignalManager always active when provided
  - Removed SignalManager from StoreHaus - now passed directly to stores
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `Dispatcher` to `StoreHaus` throughout the codebase
  - Updated all struct names, method calls, and documentation
  - Improved brand consistency and API clarity
- Enhanced documentation structure and visual presentation
  - Updated ASCII architecture diagrams with modern icons and layout
  - Improved visual consistency across all documentation files
  - Fixed rectangular borders and alignment in diagrams
  - Added emoji icons for better visual organization
  - Reorganized component responsibilities and descriptions
- Major codebase restructuring and improvements
  - Moved from dispatcher-based to storehaus-centric architecture
  - Reorganized crate structure for better modularity
  - Updated all imports and exports to use prelude modules
  - Improved error messages and debugging information
- Enhanced type system and query capabilities
  - Expanded type mapping to cover all common Rust types
  - Added intelligent parameter binding with automatic type detection
  - Improved query builder with more operators and filters
  - Better handling of complex data types (JSONB, Arrays, UUIDs)
- **BREAKING**: GenericStore constructor now accepts `CacheParams` instead of separate cache parameters
  - **Before**: `GenericStore::new(pool, signals, cache_manager, ttl, prefix)`
  - **After**: `GenericStore::new(pool, signals, cache_params)`
- Consolidated three separate examples into single comprehensive demo
- Updated Makefile commands for better clarity:
  - `make demo` - Run demo with PostgreSQL only
  - `make demo-with-cache` - Run demo with Redis cache support
  - `make demo-full` - Auto-start services and run full demo
- Enhanced README with updated usage examples and feature documentation
- Removed obsolete `version` attribute from docker-compose.yml
- Updated all examples to use `#[model]` macro instead of explicit derives

### Improved
- Better error handling and logging throughout the system
- Optimized cache key generation and TTL management
- Enhanced signal payloads with detailed event information
- Improved demo output with clearer progress indicators and test results

### Fixed
- Removed unimplemented Transaction Support from documentation and diagrams
- Corrected feature descriptions to match actual implementation
- Fixed ragged edges in ASCII architecture diagrams
- Removed all remaining "dispatcher" references from documentation
- Fixed type mapping issues for complex PostgreSQL types
  - JSONB fields now correctly mapped instead of VARCHAR
  - Optional types (Option<T>) properly handled in SQL generation
  - UUID parameters correctly bound in queries
  - RFC3339 timestamps automatically parsed and converted
- Resolved SQL parameter binding errors
  - Fixed "operator does not exist" errors for UUID comparisons
  - Corrected timestamp comparison issues
  - Implemented PostgreSQL array overlap operations
- Fixed query builder SQL generation
  - Resolved parameter spacing issues causing syntax errors
  - Improved WHERE clause construction
  - Better handling of complex filter conditions
- Clippy warnings and code quality improvements
  - Removed unnecessary borrowing and references
  - Fixed collapsible match patterns
  - Eliminated unused imports and variables
  - Improved code documentation and comments
- Duplicate email constraint errors in batch operations
- Demo cleanup issues causing conflicts on repeated runs
- Cache invalidation after update and delete operations
- Misleading documentation about advanced caching strategies
  - Removed references to unimplemented "caching strategies" from examples
  - Updated documentation to accurately reflect TTL-only caching implementation
  - Corrected ASCII diagrams to show "Expire" instead of "LRU"
  - Fixed component descriptions to match actual cache capabilities

### Removed
- Old separate example files (basic_example.rs, signals_usage.rs, cache_usage.rs)
- Unused `CreateResult` associated type from StoreObject trait
- Redundant example commands from Makefile
